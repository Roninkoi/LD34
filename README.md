#Revenge of the Ducks, made for the Ludum Dare 34 game jam

Programmed in Dart using WebGL by Ronin748.

Theme: Growing / Two button controls

You're growing old, and as we all know, elderly people like to spend time wandering around in parks. However, this time dementia got the best of you and you forgot to feed the ducks. Now they're angry and out to get you!

Use the left and right arrow keys to "waddle" forwards, and press both simultaneously to swing your walker at those dastardly drakes! As you do this, your stamina will decrease (left bar), you will slow down and your heart rate starts to rise. Don't let your heart rate get too high or you'll get a heart attack! Also don't step into puddles or you might catch a cold.
